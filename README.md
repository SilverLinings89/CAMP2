# CAMP2

## Introduction

This package contains a tool to compute the basic values for a CAMP2 Metric evaluation. Since the system compares a software system to industry averages, we need a tool to generate these baselines such that we can rank packages relative to the baseline.

This package is therefore simply a tool to evaluate base metrics for many packages.

## Required Values

To evaluate the Camp2 Metrics for a given npm package, we require the following basic values:
- Contributor count.
- Version history -> Major, minor and patch release count.
- Number of lines of code for the package and all it's dependencies.
- Download count and change over last 30 days.

## Status

In active development.
